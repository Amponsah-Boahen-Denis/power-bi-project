OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE PROJECT
This is the Cookies distribution dashboard of a 
    company that I created. I used Power BI for data cleaning and visualization. 
    One of the key observations from this project is that the company faces significant delays in distributing cookies to their customers, which can be identified by checking the date difference between the order date and the delivery date. 
    As a result, certain types of cookies are not frequently distributed to their customers.
    In the year 2017, the company experienced a significant increase in profit due to a growing number of customers."
    
CONCLUSION
 I will conclude by suggesting that the company should make efforts to 
      deliver the cookies on time. They could consider hiring more people to ensure
       timely deliveries. Additionally, it would be beneficial for them to expand their advertising
        efforts and target more restaurants to attract
       a larger customer base for their cookies
